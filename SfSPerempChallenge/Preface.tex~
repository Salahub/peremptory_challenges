\chapter*{Preface}

This work would be nowhere near as polished or complete without the effort of Prof. Dr. Marloes Maathuis to ensure I was
performing analysis with a clear direction and purpose. I would like to thank her for finding time in her busy schedule to allow
for weekly meetings. The group meetings organized by her Ph.D. student Marco Eigenmann were also critical in the development of
more nuanced analysis and intuitive visualizations. I thank Marco Eigenmann for organizing them, and Jinzhou Li, Armin Fingerle,
Sanzio Monti, and Qikun Xiang for attending my presentations and listening attentively. A special thanks is extended to C\'edric
Bleutler and Leonard Henckel, both of whom were especially engaged and participated in lengthy discussions both during and outside
of the group meetings.

I would like to acknowledge in particular Prof. Dr. Tilman Altwicker for his detailed suggestions on where to look for more legal
context on the topic and Prof. Dr. Samuel Baumgartner for his research suggestions. They were very important at providing the
necessary information to begin a first investigation of the topic. Of course, without the cooperation of Dr. Ronald Wright,
Dr. George Woodworth, Dr. Barbara O'Brien, and Dr. Catherine Grosso for generously providing me with the data from their
investigations on the subject of peremptory challenge. Without this data, the visualizations and modelling presented here simply
would not have been possible, and so I am exceptionally grateful that they were so enthusiastic to share the fruits of their
labour to help cultivate mine.
