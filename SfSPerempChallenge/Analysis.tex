\chapter{Analysis} \label{c:analysis}

With this data cleaned and processed, questions can now be posed and addressed through analysis. A few obvious questions come to
mind, considering the previous work done on this subject and the modern controversy surrounding it. First, there is the obvious
question of possible racial imbalance of peremptory challenge use and how this potential imbalance changes with the race of the
defendant. In the Gerald Stanley trial, for example, the critical aspect of the trial was not the use of peremptory challenges
in abstract, but how their use interacted with the race of Stanley.

Aside from these investigations, we may wonder whether the most common arguments posed in favour of peremptory challenge are
satisfied in this data. As discussed in \ref{sec:roleper}, there are two primary arguments. The first is the argument that the
peremptory challenge is necessary to remove the ``extremes of partiality'' present in the venire for both sides; that is to remove
the most extremely biased jurors. This goal is complemented by the ability of the judge to remove jurors with cause, which is also
designed to remove those jurors with extreme bias. The second argument is the creation of a jury which is mutually acceptable to
both parties in the trial.

\section{Extremes of Partiality} \label{sec:extremes}

While creating a quantitative judgement on the acceptability of a jury is somewhat difficult, measuring the extremality or
abnormality of observations is a critical function of statistics. With this in mind, a very simple calculation was performed. The
central claim of the advocates of the use of peremptory challenge is that it is only used to remove extreme cases of bias. If that
is so, then the proportion of venire members removed by peremptory challenge should reflect this concept.

Of course, this cannot be rigorously tested, as there is no way of knowing the true distribution of bias among jurors. That does
not mean nothing can be said, however. Each individual in the population will have opinions which imbue a bias for a given
case. The relevant opinions across all individuals in the population will form some distribution of bias ranging from individuals
biased heavily for conviction before seeing evidence to individuals biased heavily against conviction before seeing
evidence. Viewing the rate at which venire members are rejected in the data allows inference of what proportion of the population
is 'too extreme' to judge the average trial. A distributional assumption refines this proportion into a measure of distance for a
symmetric rejection rule.

As \cite{nisbett1985} notes, there is a tendency for people to assume a normal distribution normal when asked to guess the
distribution of social attitudes. This is unsurprising. The ubiquity of the normal distribution throughout science gives it a
central position in the way the typical person conceptualizes any distribution. Such reasoning is supported by \cite{nisbett1985}
and suggests that when the average person hears of extremality in a distribution, their view is reasonably assumed to be the tails
of a normal distribution. It is therefore not unreasonable to assume that the proponents of peremptory challenge may view the
distribution of bias in the population as normally distributed.

Additionally, mathematical constraints such as the Chebyshev inequality (see \cite{chebyshev}) provide an upper limit to the
dispersion of any distribution. The Chebyshev limit gives an estimate of the proportion of observations above a given distance
from the mean given a maximally dispersed distribution. In case bias terms the proportion of individuals further from the mean,
``unbiased'' opinion, than some standard distance in a population which is maximally biased both for and against.

Table \ref{tab:rejbounds} provides a summary of the rejection rates of the different data sets and the implied distances from the mean,
in standard deviations, that these imply for symmetric rejection. Note that two rows are provided for the Sunshine data, the first
for the entire data set of jury trials and the second for first degree murder\footnote{The only sentence with the potential of a
  death penalty, as informed by the sentencing guidelines   provided in \cite{offenseclass}.}. This was done to facilitate
comparison, as both the Stubborn Legacy and Philadelphia dataset only addressed capital cases\footnote{It should be noted that
  there is still some difference in studied populations, as the previous studies looked at individuals sentenced to death, while
  no individuals in this data set were sentenced to death.}.

\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \caption[Implied Rejection Boundaries]{\footnotesize The implied statistical extremity bound for symmetric rejection in the datasets given
    different distributional assumptions} \label{tab:rejbounds}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
    Data & Rejection Rate & Normal & Chebyshev Limit \\ \hline
    Sunshine & 0.434 & 0.781 & 1.517 \\
    Sunshine Capital & 0.639 & 0.470 & 1.251 \\
    Stubborn & 0.659 & 0.442 & 1.232 \\
    Philadelphia & 0.736 & 0.337 & 1.166 \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The normal rejection bounds are visualized in Figure \ref{fig:rejbnds}, where the areas shaded red give the rejection regions for
the correspoding data sets. From left to right in the negative distances, the areas correspond to the full Sunshine, Sunshine
capital, Stubborn, and Philadelphia data sets.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \epsfCfile{0.7}{RejectionBound}
  \caption[Normal Rejection Boundaries Visualized]{\footnotesize The rejected areas for each data set given the observed
    proportion of struck venire members and assuming a normal distribution.}
  \label{fig:rejbnds}
\end{figure}

The narrowness of the implied acceptance regions, indicated by the white region for the Philadelphia data and the lighter red
regions for all other data sets, suggests that the peremptory challenge is not being used exclusively to remove extreme
individuals from the population. Indeed, as the rejection bounds are typically less than or near one standard deviation from the
mean, this suggests that the average individual sampled from the population is ``extremely partial'' in the eyes of the
court. Such rejection is inconsistent with the concept of a jury as the ``conscience of the community,'' one of the core
philosophies of a jury trial, and implies the overuse of rejections by the court in some way.

Obviously, the above reasoning has some flaws. It is not possible to comment with authority on the presence of partiality in the
population. Critically, if the population has a tendency to be biased as a whole, \textit{i.e.} the ``unbiased'' opinion is not
the mean of the population distribution, the above arguments on symmetric extremity break down, and such high rejection rates may
very well be appropriate to find the unbiased jurors.

Such criticism may be supported by the increased use of peremptory challenges for the capital cases in the data. As is clear
viewing historical Gallup polls on the topic (\cite{gallupdeath}), opinions on the death penalty and murder trials are far more
polarized and have varied greatly over time in the United States. At times the population has been biased as a whole to favour the
death penalty for murder trials by a very wide margin. In the case of murder trials, then, perhaps only a minority of the
population holds reasonable unbiased views on the subject.

Consequently, the rejection rates are suggestive, but may be misleading. It is impossible to conclusively state whether more
individuals are being rejected from serving on the jury than the proper amount. Indeed, the concept of the ``appropriate'' amount
of rejection is unclear given the lack of detailed knowledge of the population bias as a whole on a case-by-case basis. However,
given the history of peremptory challenges and the legally successful arguments of their over-utilization on certain groups,
further investigation on the venire members for which data exists is warranted.

\section{The Impact of Race} \label{sec:impactrace} 

The racially-motivated controversy surrounding peremptory provides one hypothesis in the pattern of venire member rejection which
may be so investigated. To begin, a simple marginal investigation was performed to explore the impact of the simplified race on
the peremptory strike probability. The result of this investigation is displayed in Table \ref{tab:margrace}. Of particular
interest is whether any race is far more likely to be struck by peremptory challenge than the others, as this might suggest that
race is the target of the over-use of strikes.

\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \caption[Strike Rate by Race]{\footnotesize The conditional probability of a venire member being struck peremptorily by the simplified venire
    member race across data sets. These values are smaller than the values presented in the extremity analysis as only the
    individuals which were identifiably removed by peremptory challenge are counted in this table. Regardless, the comparisons 
    remain similar if the unattributed removals are included. Note that the Philadelphia trial data only indicated black and
    non-black venire members and so only two numbers can be reported.} \label{tab:margrace}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c c c|} \hline
    Data & Black & Other & White \\ \hline
    Sunshine & 0.23 & 0.24 & 0.25 \\
    Sunshine Capital & 0.22 & 0.27 & 0.27 \\
    Stubborn & 0.65 & 0.36 & 0.66 \\ 
    Philadelphia & 0.67 & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{0.68} \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

These probabilities are different, but not greatly so. Indeed, the trend of higher probabilities for the removal of white jurors
across all data sets is perhaps counter-intuitive given the history of peremptory challenge controversy in the United States. In
any case, the small magnitude of these differences seems to suggest that there is no strong racial bias at the aggregate level,
whether or not the results are statistically significant\footnote{Consider the numerical impact of a statistically significant
  difference of a few percent when the jury size is 12 for each trial.}. Perhaps there is a more interesting race-dependent
relationship to be uncovered. Taking inspiration from \textit{Swain v. Alabama}, \textit{Batson v. Kentucky}, and
\textit{R. v. Stanley}, viewing the relationship between venire member race and defendant race could be informative. This
relationship is displayed in Figure \ref{fig:racedefmob}.

\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering
  \epsfCfile{0.7}{RaceParCoord}
  \caption[The ``Mobile Plot'' of Racial Combination and
  Strikes (Sunshine)]{\footnotesize The conditional probability of successful challenges given the
    venire member and defendant race, with the expected value represented by the horizontal black line, and the observed values
    represented by the point at the end of the dotted line. Each horizontal black line corresponds to a particular venire member
    and defendant race combination, with a length proportional to the number of venire members with that combination. The dashed
    vertical lines, coloured by challenge source, start at these horizontal lines and end at points which show the observed
    probability of a challenge by that source for the given racial combination.}
  \label{fig:racedefmob}
\end{figure}

A detailed description of this plot and its development which includes a discussion of the principles of graphics and perception
which were used to devise its form is presented in \ref{app:devmob}\footnote{Here it suffices to mention that much of its design
  was motivated by the philosophy of \cite{VisualDisplayQuant} and the results of \cite{cleveland1987} on the accuracy of visual
  perception.}. Henceforth in the paper, plots of this type for visualizing three way relationships of categorical variables will
be referred to as ``mobile plots.'' The most interesting patterns visible in this particular mobile plot will be discussed here.

First, a small explanation of this mobile plot. This mobile plot displays the relationship between three categorical variables:
venire member race, defendant race, and disposition (whether a venire member is struck and by whom). The vertical axis corresponds
to the conditional probability of the disposition given a race and defendant race combination\footnote{Generally, any three
  categorical variables can be displayed using a mobile plot, as the mobile plot is used to display the distribution of a
  categorical variable given the combinations of the other two. Mathematically it displays $X_3|X_1,X_2$.}. Racial combinations
are placed along the horizontal axis, and each combination corresponds to one horizontal black line in the plotting area. The
length of these lines is proportional to the number of venire members in the data with the corresponding racial combination, and
their vertical positions are the mean conditional probability of a venire member being removed by a challenge, causal or
peremptory, for that particular combination. The dashed vertical lines, coloured by disposition, start at this mean line and
extend to the observed conditional probability of the corresponding disposition for the relevant racial combination. As a
consequence, this plot can be viewed as a visualization of the test of a specific hypothesis:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:vishyp}
  D | D \in \{2,3,4\}, R, E \sim Unif(\{2,3,4\})
\end{equation}

Where $D, R, E$ are random variables representing the disposition, venire member race, and defendant race respectively as outlined
in \ref{not:variables}. In words: the conditional distribution of the disposition given both rejection and the racial combination
is uniform. This implies that causal challenges, defence strikes, and prosecution strikes occur with the same probability for each
racial combination, though they may differ between racial combinations. Such a hypothesis allows for certain racial combinations
to experience a higher strike rate generally, but constrains the strike rate to be the same for all parties, which would imply
that all parties in the court pursue an identical strike strategy across all venire member and defendant race combinations.

Clearly, Figure \ref{fig:racedefmob} casts some doubt on this hypothesis. While the horizontal black lines tell a very similar
story to Table \ref{tab:margrace}, with little variation between them except for in small population subsets, a number of other
striking patterns are visible. The first, and most obvious of these, is the main effect of venire member race. While the aggregate
removal rates do not seem to depend on the race of the venire member, it is clear that the defence and prosecution pursue
radically different strategies. The defence seems biased towards a jury with more venire members from visible minorities. All
orange points are below the horizontal lines for the black and other venire members, indicating these groups are less likely to be
struck by the defence than expected, while the points are above the lines for the white venire members, indicating a higher than
expected probability of defence removal for white venire members. The prosecution seems to mirror this tendency, striking the
white venire members at a lower rate than expected and the black venire members more often than expected. The prosecution seems to
show no deviation from expectation for the venire members of other races, and otherwise always deviates from expectation in the
same direction as the prosecution.

The addition of defendant races shows another interesting trend. It would seem that the aforementioned tendencies of the
prosecution and defence are strongest for black defendants, which have the strongest departure of the conditional probabilities
from the expectation. The defense and prosecution seem to have slightly more similar habits when the defendant is white, despite
their opposite tendencies in all cases. Finally, it would seem that the removals with cause have tendencies similar to the
prosecution, as the points representing the conditional probability of a venire member being removed with cause are always on the
same side of the expected line, an event which would occur with probability $2^{-9} \approx 0.002$ under the hypothesis of
independent uniform strike rates. Further discussion of the agreement of these two strike tendencies can be found in
\ref{sec:mods}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \epsfCfile{0.7}{RaceDefCI}
  \caption[Racial Combination and Strikes with Confidence
  Intervals (Sunsine)]{\footnotesize The plot of conditional strike probability by racial
    combination from above with confidence intervals added. Note that many of the seemingly striking departures seen are
    insignificant when these confidence intervals are applied.}
  \label{fig:racedefci}
\end{figure}

While Figure \ref{fig:racedefmob} is quite suggestive, the widths of certain horizontal black lines, in particular those for
venire members with a race other than white or black, suggest that perhaps some of the more extreme tendencies are simply a result
of the well-known higher variation of samples with small sizes. In order to see the true nature of the noted departures some
incorporation of the variation one expects from each observed value is required. This is accomplished by the addition of
approximate 95\%  simultaneous multinomial confidence intervals using the \texttt{MultinomialCI} package in \Rp, which implements
simultaneous confidence intervals for multinomial proportions following the method presented in \cite{sison1995}. These confidence
intervals can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:racedefci}.

As suspected, some of the results for the smaller sample sizes do not seem to be significant. The results for the larger groups,
in particular for white venire members or black defendants, are significant, however. It should be noted that these simultaneous
confidence intervals do not constitute a proper statistical test of the impact of race, they are rather a way of visually
providing a viewer some sense of the expected variability in the data over repeated sampling. More rigorous testing requires
controlling the impact of confouding factors, as done by the modelling in \ref{sec:mods}.

\subsection{In the Stubborn and Philadelphia Data}

With the patterns for the entire Sunshine data set examined, it is important to see how general this pattern is. It is entirely
possible that the Sunshine data simply shows a particularly bad year in North Carolina, and so seeing whether this pattern is
present over time and in different regions is important to motivate its generality. To that end, Figure \ref{fig:racedefmob} was
reproduced for the Sunshine capital cases, the Stubborn data, and the Philadelphia data. These plots can be see in Figure 
\ref{fig:racedefalldata}.

Three important differences between Figure \ref{fig:racedefalldata} and  Figure \ref{fig:racedefci} must be noted when
interpreting these visualizations. The first of these is that data differences have limited the scope of the comparison to simply
the prosecution and defence strike rates, as the Stubborn data does not include any information on strikes with cause. Second, the
Sunshine data used to generate the mobile plot in Figure \ref{fig:racedefalldata} is filtered to only the first degree murder
trials, as the other two data sets only addressed capital trials (i.e. those with the death penalty), while the Sunshine data had
a broader scope. Finally, the race and defendant race were further simplified to logical indicators of whether the race variable
was black or not.

\begin{figure}[h!]

  \caption[Strikes by Race and Defendant Race (All Capital Trial Data)]
  {\footnotesize The conditional probability of defence and prosecution peremptory challenge by racial minority status across all
    capital trials in all data sets. The pattern, though sometimes different in magnitude, is quite consistent across the three
    examined data sets, despite the significant differences in the respective study sample universes.}
  \label{fig:racedefalldata}
\end{figure}

Despite the very different study sample universes of these three data sets, all display identical patterns, with only the
magnitudes of the different strike rates differing. The mobile plot format makes several interesting patterns immediately
clear. The similar level of all black lines within each plot shows that in each data set, the aggregate probability of removal is
similar across racial minority combinations. However, these aggregate similarities hide the vastly different strategies of the
defence and prosecution which are consistent across the data. The defence has a tendency to retain visible minority venire
members, striking them at a lower rate than the white venire members, while the prosecution shows a pattern which mirrors that of
the defence, removing more visible minorities and fewer white venire members. In all data sets the gap between these probabilities
and the implied removal rates is greatest for the black venire members in cases with black defendants.

It should be noted that the Sunshine data set looks most unique of the three, and this may be a result of the sample size. While
the Philadelphia data and Stubborn data both collected data which included multiple years, the Sunshine data was restricted to
trials which occurred in 2012. This small sample is the reason for the large confidence intervals present in Figure
\ref{fig:suncomp}. This small sample size does not explain the overall lower strike rate observed in the capital trials in this
data, which is also visible in Table \ref{tab:margrace}. This departure may be of interest for further investigation.

\section{Other Factors} \label{sec:otherfact}

Of course, it would be incorrect to conclude immediately that the cause of the racial patterns observed across these data sets is
race itself. There may be a plethora of attitudes associated with race that could serve as legitimate cause for a peremptory
challenge. As noted by Justice Byron R. White in the majority opinion in \cite{swainvalabama}

\begin{quote}
  [The peremptory challenge] is no less frequently exercised on grounds normally thought irrelevant to legal proceedings or
  official action, namely, the race, religion, nationality, occupation or affiliations of people summoned for jury duty. For the
  question a prosecutor or defense counsel must decide is not whether a juror of a particular race or nationality is in fact
  partial, but whether one from a different group is less likely to be.
\end{quote}

This quote leads directly to the heart of the problem. Without detailed transcripts indicating how the venire members were
questioned, it cannot be known if the aggregate pattern of removal is the result of racially based strikes, or whether the lawyers
determined valid reasons for a peremptory challenge during the voir dire process which are simply related to race. For example, if
defence attorneys reasonably assumed that trust in and deference to authority and law enforcement would make a venire member
predisposed to reject arguments provided about possible mishandling of evidence without proper consideration, this would be
reasonable grounds for peremptory challenges of individuals with that opinion. If such opinions were distributed heterogeneously
by race, the aggregate pattern may appear to reflect racially-based decision making by the defence
attorneys\footnote{\cite{StubbornLegacy} and \cite{PerempChalMurder} both provide such detailed attitudinal survey data, but how
  this data interacted with the questions asked during voire dire is unclear. Additionally, it is missing in the
  \cite{JurySunshineProj} data.}. 

\subsection{Political Affiliation in the Sunshine Data} \label{sec:polaff}

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \epsfCfile{0.7}{RaceGenderPolit}
  \caption[Political Affiliation by Race and Gender (Sunshine)]
  {\footnotesize Conditional probabilities of political affiliation by race and gender. In this plot, it is clear the black venire
    members are far more homogeneous than the white venire members for both genders, with the vast majority voting Democrat.} 
  \label{fig:racepolit}
\end{figure}

\cite{revesz2016} provides, inadvertently, data which might support the above defence of peremptory challenges on the basis of
confounding variables in the United States. He notes that the distribution of political affiliation in the United States is not
consistent across races, with black voters far more likely to vote for the Democratic Party and far less likely to vote for the
Republican Party, while white voters are more uniformly distributed and likely to vote independently. If political affiliation is
used as a surrogate for ideology and point of view, this suggests that the observed pattern in the Sunshine data could be the
result of defence lawyers removing conservative venire members and prosecution lawyers attempting to remove liberal ones. As the
Sunshine data has political affiliation, the results of \citeauthor{revesz2016} can be compared to this data. The resulting
figure, Figure \ref{fig:racepolit}, displays the conditional probability of political affiliation across races and genders.

What is immediately apparent viewing this plot and the data in \cite{revesz2016} is how closely the two data sets agree. Black
voters vote Democratic a vast majority of the time, while the political leanings of white voters are less cohesive. Note
additionally that the horizontal lines in this plot are all very close to 0.33, as almost all voters are Democrat, Republican, or
independent. The ``ideological imbalance'' of racial voting tendencies, as \citeauthor{revesz2016} aptly calls it, is a clear
confounding factor and a possible source of a legitimate cause for an initially suspect overall trend. As such, it was
investigated using the mobile plot.

To control for the defendant race as well, which already appears to be important, the venire members were split into the
simplified racial groups black, white, and other. Then mobile plots of the conditional strike probabilities for the different
venire member races given the defendant race and political affiliation were generated. Figures \ref{fig:blackdefpol},
\ref{fig:otherdefpol}, and \ref{fig:whitedefpol} display these mobile plots.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}{0.40\textwidth}

    \caption{\footnotesize Black Venire Members}

    \caption{\footnotesize White Venire Members}

    \caption{\footnotesize Other Venire Members}
    \label{fig:otherdefpol}

  \caption[Strikes by Political Affiliation, Race, and Defendant Race (Sunshine)]
  {\footnotesize Conditional probability of venire member strike by defendant race and political affiliation, split by race. Note how the
    pattern of conditional probabilities is the same across political affiliations for the same defendant race within a particular
    venire member race, and this pattern is the aggregate pattern seen in Figure \ref{fig:racedefmob}} \label{fig:racedefpol}
\end{figure}

This sequence of three plots immediately suggests that a political argument is insufficient for this data. For each venire member
race and defendant race, the political affiliation of the venire member does not radically change the pattern of strikes for any
party in the court. Rather, the court tendencies for each political affiliation, venire member race, and defendant race seem to
follow the pattern seen in \ref{fig:racedefmob} for all political affiliations with the exception of some very small subgroups of
black venire members\footnote{The subgroups, black republican venire members for white or other race defendants, have sizes 1 and
  10, respectively. The study examines a total of 29636 venire members.}. It should be noted that many of the other, less
noticeable subgroups represented by this particular set of plots will be too small to provide statistically significantly
results. Regardless of these difficulties with sample size, the consistency of the pattern of strikes across political
affiliations provides rather stark evidence against a hypothesis of political affiliation as a primary cause of the strikes in the
data.

\subsection{Gender in the Sunshine Data}

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \epsfCfile{0.7}{RaceGenderStrike}
  \caption[Strike Source by Race and Gender (Sunshine)]
  {\footnotesize Conditional probabilities of strike source by race and gender. Note that the pattern is nearly identical for the genders within
    each racial group.} \label{fig:racegenpol}
\end{figure}

Another factor which may have an impact is that of gender. While \textit{J.E.B. v. Alabama} (\cite{jebvalabama}) has also ruled
peremptory challenges for this reason alone unconstitutional in the United States, it is noted in \cite{vandykejurysel} on page
152-153 that prosecutor's guidelines have, in the past, recommended using peremptory challenges to remove female venire
members\footnote{\citeauthor{vandykejurysel} provides specific guidelines for sex written by Jon Sparling, an assistant district
  attorney in Dallas, which read: \begin{enumerate} 
  \item I don't like women jurors because I don't trust them.
  \item They do, however, make the best jurors in cases involving crimes against children.
  \item It is possible that their ``women's intuition''[sic] can help you if you can't win your case with the facts.
  \item Young women too often sympathize with the Defendant; old women wearing too much make-up are usually unstable, and
    therefore are bad State's jurors.
  \end{enumerate}
  If data on make-up use and jury outcome is ever collected perhaps Mr. Sparling's bold claim can be tested, but until then it is
  better treated as prejudice.}, and so perhaps it is a relevant factor. Additionally, there is a relationship between gender and
race in the data, as noted in \cite{JurySunshineProj}: black males are highly under-represented relative to black
females. Luckily, the relationship between race, gender, and peremptory challenges can be visualized quite neatly without the need
to split the plots as was done in Figure \ref{fig:racedefpol}. Figure \ref{fig:racegenpol} displays the mobile plot for race,
gender, and strike source.

The same pattern is seen here for the most part, that of a dearth of defence strikes against visible minorities and a surplus
against white venire members, with a mirrored tendency for both the prosecution and challenges with cause. One may be motivated
next to ask whether such oppositional patterns are just a quirk of the data or display method. Perhaps conditioning on gender
alone, for example, would create a similar pattern of tendencies of the court. Figure \ref{fig:gengen} shows a plot of the court's
strike tendencies given the gender of venire member to defendant gender to investigate this possibility.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \epsfCfile{0.7}{GenderGenderStrike}
  \caption[Strike Source by Race and Gender (Sunshine)]
  {\footnotesize Conditional probabilities of strike source by venire member gender and defendant gender. The characteristic swap
    between racial minorities and white venire members and the oppositional preferences of the prosecution and defence cannot be
    seen here.} \label{fig:gengen}
\end{figure}

The characteristic pattern seen throughout the other plots is not present. At this point the message from these additional mobile
plots should be clear. That is, the dominant determinant of the strike probability for a venire member is their race. The race of
the defendant does impact this somewhat, but plots across gender and political affiliation for both venire members and defendants
in numerous combinations suggest that race is the dominant factor in determining the probability a venire member will be struck by
the prosecution, defense, or removed by cause. This hypothesis, motivated by these plots, is examined more rigorously through the
construction and testing of specific models in \ref{sec:mods}.

\subsection{The Stubborn and Philadelphia Data Sets}

\cite{StubbornLegacy} and \cite{PerempChalMurder} did not collect data on the political affiliation of the venire
members\footnote{While it is perhaps possible that the different combinations of the attitudinal data collected by these groups
  could be used with data on the voter profiles most typically associated with the political affiliations of different groups in
  the United States, such an investigation is beyond the scope of this text. Lacking such a predictor, it is also unclear which
  attitudinal variables would be most comparable to the political affiliation, and so attempting to compare this pattern would be
  futile.}, and \cite{StubbornLegacy} did not record the gender of the defendant. Consequently, of the above plots, only Figure
\ref{fig:racegenpol} can be compared to these two data sets. Figure \ref{fig:genderalldata} displays the plots. Note that as
before, the data has been restricted to ensure analogous study universes across the data sets.

This, again, shows a pattern very similar to the overall Sunshine data, and the differences in pattern between these data sets are
minor. The race of the venire member seems to be analogously important across all data sets as it was in Figure
\ref{fig:racedefalldata}. Such similarity is somewhat surprising, as these data sets have considerably different sample
universes both spatially and temporally as discussed in \ref{c:data}. When displayed visually as above, the similarities are
nothing short of striking.

\section{Modelling} \label{sec:mods}

\subsection{Multinomial Logistic Regression}

Despite how suggestive these above results are for the Sunshine data set, refining the estimates for the impact of race on the
probability of rejection and controlling for the myriad of possible confounding factors motivated the fitting of multiple
models. This is helped by the deliberately suggestive nature of the mobile plots used in Figure \ref{fig:racedefmob} and
elsewhere. The plot displays the conditional distribution of a categorical variable with multiple levels, which evokes ideas of a
conditional multinomial distribution to the statistically-minded. Consequently, fitting multinomial log-linear regression seemed a
natural choice.

It should be noted that early modelling instead used Poisson regression due to the difference in implementations of multinomial
regression (based on neural networks in \texttt{nnet}) and Poisson regression (based on iteratively-reweighted least squares in
\texttt{glm}). The implementation difference, however, is not due to a difference in theory. As the conditional distribution of a
particular outcome given some marginal count is multinomial (as shown in \ref{app:mathres}), these two models are essentially
equivalent. There are known transforms (\cite{baker1994}) to move between the models and their equivalencies are well documented
(\cite{lang1996}). Multinomial regression was chosen for greater interpretability, as in a Poisson model the parameters of
interest were all interactions as opposed to main effects. The specific implementation of multinomial regression utilized is the
\texttt{multinom} function in the \texttt{nnet} package in \Rp, which implements a method of fitting multinomial models discussed
in \cite{nnet}.

In multinomial regresson, the coefficients for each possible outcome generated for each factor of interest are log odds ratios of
that outcome relative to some reference level, called a pivot. Mathematically, the coefficients give how a change in the
independent variables changes $\frac{\pi_i}{\pi_{pivot}}$. For all models, the pivot outcome chosen was the probability of a
venire member sitting on the final jury, in other words the probability their disposition was coded as ``Kept.'' Coefficients were
then estimated using treatment contrasts with a black female venire member with Democrat voting tendencies in a case with a black female
defendant used as the reference treatment (using the notation from \ref{not:variables}: the reference venire member combination is
$\mathbf{x} = (1,1,1,1,1,1)^T$).

While the choice of race, gender, and political affiliation for the reference level was not deliberate, the choice of pivot
outcome, that of a venire member being kept, was made in order to make the visualizations constructed using the coefficients
clearer and easier to compare to previous visualizations. Previous visualizations, including the mobile plots, have displayed the
conditional probabilities of removal with cause and strikes by defence and prosecution, and if any were used as the pivot their
coefficient estimates would be hidden as the intercept.

The mobile plots created in \ref{sec:otherfact} and \ref{sec:impactrace} suggest, primarily, that an interaction between race and
defendant race is relevant in modelling the conditional probability of venire member rejection. These plots do not suggest that
any other interactions are likely to be significant. This led to a model:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:fullmod}
  \begin{split}
    \log \frac{\pi_d^{(i)}}{\pi_1^{(i)}} & = a_d + \mathbf{x}_i^T \beta + (re)_i \beta_{re} \\
    & = a_i + r_i \beta_r + e_i \beta_e + p_i \beta_p + g_i \beta_g + s_i \beta_s + (re)_i \beta_{re}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

The fundamental purpose of fitting this model is to test two effects. The first is whether the interaction between defendant race
and venire member race is significant, as has been suggested by the controversial trials named in \ref{c:background}, and the
second is whether the venire member race is a significant factor in the presence of the other controlled factors. These two
assumptions can be testing by fitting models nested in \ref{eq:fullmod}:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:noraceintmod}
  \log \frac{\pi_d^{(i)}}{\pi_1^{(i)}} = a_d + \mathbf{x}_i^T \beta
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:novmmod}
  \log \frac{\pi_d^{(i)}}{\pi_1^{(i)}} = a_d + \mathbf{x}_i^T \beta^{\prime}
\end{equation}

Where $\beta^{\prime}_r = 0$. Comparing \ref{eq:noraceintmod} and \ref{eq:novmmod} to \ref{eq:fullmod} gives striking
results. These can be see in Table \ref{tab:modcomp}, which compares the deviances of the different models sequentially.

\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \caption[Model Comparisons to Determine the Importance of
  Race]{\footnotesize Comparison of models \ref{eq:novmmod} and \ref{eq:noraceintmod}
    to \ref{eq:fullmod}, displaying the residual deviance, residual degrees of freedom, differences, and p-value of these
    differences for adjacent models.}
  \label{tab:modcomp}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline

    \ref{eq:noraceintmod} & 55521 & 39087 & 405 & ~0 \\
    \ref{eq:fullmod} & 55509 & 39023 & 67 & 1.4e-9 \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Even when controlling for defendant characteristics and the venire member's political affiliation and sex, the race of the venire
member and its interaction with the defendant race are both highly significant at the $\alpha = 0.05$ level. This suggests that
the rejection of venire members is, at least in part, based on their racial characteristics. Whether this is due to opinions
associated with race or not is impossible to say from this data, but the control of political affiliation provides a suggestion
that commonly held opinions within racial groups are not the cause. Note that the residual deviance values suggest that this model
is underdispersed, suggesting that the significant test results gained are conservative.

Due to its significance compared to the other models, \ref{eq:fullmod} was taken as the final model to estimate the race effects
with precision. The estimated coefficients for the different effects and their approximate 95\% confidence intervals, calculated
using the standard errors of the coefficients and using a normal assumption\footnote{This assumption is only valid asymptotically,
  but for the large demographic groups the estimates are still a useful guide.}, are displayed in Table
\ref{tab:fullmodracecoef}.

\subsection{Examining the Coefficients} \label{sec:examcoef}

This table is somewhat daunting and difficult to interpret. No sense for the relative magnitudes of the coefficients or their
significance is offered by the precise recording of all values. This motivated further visualization of these parameter estimates
in an intuitive and simple way. Motivated by \cite{dotwhisker}, a custom dot and whisker plot was generated. This plot displays
the coefficient estimates as points in the centre of a line, the endpoints of which give the associated confidence intervals. A
vertical line is placed at zero to provide a reference for the sign and significance of different parameters. Modifying this
concept to suit the multinomial regression data was simple, as it only required grouping the different possible outcomes for each
parameter spatially. Figure \ref{fig:allmodcoef} displays these parameter estimates in the dot-whisker format.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \epsfCfile{0.7}{AllModCoef}
  \caption[All Model Coefficients]{\footnotesize Model coefficients from the full model, \ref{eq:fullmod}, displayed using
    a dot-whisker plot. The lines indicate the confidence intervals while the central points indicate the point estimates of
    coefficients.}
  \label{fig:modallcoef}
\end{figure}

This plot is considerably less daunting than the table, and provides a much clearer picture of the magnitudes, signs, and
significances of the variables. However, there is still considerable visual clutter. As was noted as early as Figure
\ref{fig:racedefci}, the sample sizes in the Sunshine data set corresponding to racial groups other than white or black are too
small to make statements of significance. This same pattern is observed here, were all coefficients estimating the effects of
other racial groups have wider confidence intervals and are rarely significant. Additionally, the lack of libertarian voters
creates large uncertainty about the estimates of this parameter as well. To provide a clearer picture of the racial coefficient
estimates and the effect of the other controls, a second dot-whisker plot was generated excluding these parameter estimates in
Figure \ref{fig:modselcoef}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \epsfCfile{0.7}{SelectModCoef}
  \caption[Select Model Coefficients]{\footnotesize Select model coefficients from the full model displayed using a dot-whisker
    plot. The lines indicate the confidence intervals while the central points indicate the point estimates of coefficients.}
  \label{fig:modselcoef}
\end{figure}

The first feature of this plot to notice is the position of the coefficient estimates relative to the black line at zero. This
indicates the sign of the coefficient, where a positive sign indicates that a coefficient increases the probability of a venire
member being struck by a particular source in the presence of the factor corresponding to the coefficient and a negative sign
indicates that the presence of said factor decreases the probability of a venire member being struck. The pattern of positive and
negative values suggests the uncontrolled patterns noticed in the mobile plots were not completely wrong.

First, take a broad overview of the patterns. The variables which show the greatest significance and the characteristic
oppositional tendencies of the prosecution and defence are all race variables. The effect of a white venire member, white
defendant, and their interaction all display significant, and opposite, tendencies for the prosecution and defence. Moreover, the
magnitude of the defence coefficients is always greater than the prosecution for the race variables. This suggests that the
defence probability to strike is affected far more by race variables than the prosecution probability to strike. To put this more
simply, the defence is more sensitive to the racial aspects of the trial in general.

A quick survey of the prosecution and cause coefficients shows far less agreement than seemed apparent in the mobile
plots. Scanning from the top to the bottom, the cause coefficients match the prosecution for a few groups, but are generally quite 
different and are often more similar to the defence than the prosecution. The suggestive pattern of matching prosecution strikes
and causal strikes viewed in \ref{sec:impactrace} vanishes when controls are placed on possible confounders\footnote{This serves
  as an excellent demonstration of how complex multiple confounders can create spurious patterns.}. In general, the cause strike
coefficients are lower in magnitude than both the prosecution and defence, with the notable exception of the effect for male
venire members, where it is significantly greater than both.

In order to look more specifically some important differentiation is necessary between the intercept values and the other
coefficients. As with all linear models, the intercept values provide a locational measure. That is to say, the intercepts provide
the base level upon which the coefficients act. Consequentially, the negative values of the intercept for all strike sources is to
be expected. In the Sunshine data more venire members were kept than rejected, as can be seen in Tables \ref{tab:margrace} and
\ref{tab:rejbounds}, and so the intercept, which gives the log odds ratio of each strike outcome to the venire member being kept,
would naturally be negative for all strike sources.

The more important feature to note for this intercept is the large difference between the different strike sources, without
overlapping confidence intervals. These suggest that all three strike sources behave differently in the reference group, which
consists of a female, black, Democrat venire member in a case with a female, black defendant. Crucially, the defence intercept is
far lower than the prosecution, matching what was observed in Figure \ref{fig:racedefmob}, where the lowest defence strike
probability occurred for black venire members in cases with black defendants. Also visible in this figure is an increase in
defence strike probability and decrease in prosecution strike probability for a white defendant with a black venire member. This
pattern is reflected perfectly in the positive defence coefficient and negative prosecution coefficient for white defendants.

The coefficients for white venire members also match the expectations of Figure \ref{Fig:racedefmob}. The defence attains its
largest positive coefficient for this group and the prosecution is largest negative value. The dominant effect of venire member
race visible throughout the mobile plots in \ref{sec:otherfact} and \ref{sec:impactrace} is reflected by the dominance of the
magnitudes of the coefficients for white venire members relative to the reference black venire members. The defence is much more
likely to reject a white venire member and the prosecution much less likely.

Slightly attenuating this pattern is the interaction effect between a white defendant and a white venire member. For this specific
combination, the defence is less likely to reject than for a white venire member with a black defendant, while the prosecution is
more likely to reject. Both of these trends seem to be significant based on the plotted confidence intervals. Combine this
observation with the almost mirrored pattern for a white defendant with a black venire member (given by the white defendant
coefficient), and a more nuanced strategy becomes clear. While the prosecution dominantly rejects black venire members and the
defence dominantly rejects white venire members, they are also sensitive to possible racial matches. The defence pattern is
consistent with a strategy which aims to partially select for venire members which have the same race as the defendant, while the
prosecution has the opposite pattern.

This pattern is precisely the problematic behaviour which was implied by the individuals that viewed the Gerald Stanley murder
trial as a travesty. While the data here \textit{cannot} reveal anything about that \textit{specific} trial, or indeed about the
exercise of peremptory challenges in Canada generally. That such a pattern is clearly present in the data will no doubt feel
vindicating for those still musing on its perceived injustice.

Such racial patterns in the prosecution and the defence dominate all other effects. The political effect is minor, though
consistent with the hypothesis put forward by \cite{revesz2016}, with a preference for Republicans by the prosecution and a
preference for Democrats by the defence. Interestingly, all strike sources seem to have an increased probability for male venire
members, suggesting a universal preference for female venire members on the jury. One would hope that this pattern is for some
other reason than anything listed on pages 152-153 of \cite{vandykejurysel} and reproduced here in \ref{sec:polaff}. While no
detailed explanation is forthcoming for this pattern in the presence of racial and political affiliation controls, it would
certainly be an interesting avenue for further research, as the exercise of peremptory challenges based purely on gender is also
protected since \textit{J.E.B. v. Alabama} (\cite{jebvalabama}).

A lack of consistent information between data sets and of time made fitting additional models using the other data sets more
difficult. Regardless of the lack of specific coefficient comparisons due to these difficulties, the above findings are consistent
with the modelling results in \cite{StubbornLegacy} and \cite{PerempChalMurder}. Both of these studies performed logistic
regression analysis of the prosecution strike patterns, controlling for attitudinal variables. In both cases, the venire member
race remained a significant predictor of the venire member removal. Additionally, \citeauthor{PerempChalMurder} fit analogous
models for the defence strike use and found the race remained significant even when the attitudinal variables were
controlled. The resuls of the modelling performed here add evidence to this mounting case of racial importance in the execution of
peremptory challenges.
                
\section{Trial Level Summary} \label{sec:casesum}

While \cite{JurySunshineProj} reported a great deal of aggregate statistics about the venire members themselves, one piece of
investigation which was lacking was an analysis which aggregated and viewed the trends for the cases, rather than simply for
individual venire members. As we cannot know why a potential venire member is struck individually, and viewing their aggregate
statistics tells us nothing about how different strikes relate to each other, it is possible we are viewing some effect which is
not a result of persistent bias across trials, but is rather the result of some other effect.

By aggregating the venire members by trial and viewing the demographic trends in strikes and behaviour at this level, we gain a
more detailed insight into the impact of challenges at a more relevant scale. Additionally, such aggregation allows for the
synthesis of certain measures, such as a disitributional difference via the Kullback-Leibler divergence (\cite{kullback1951}),
which would otherwise not be well defined. This particular perspective of the data has also not been explored by any other studies
known to the author.

\subsection{Estimating Struck Juror Counts} \label{subsec:struckjur}

One gap which was present in the Sunshine data was the total count of defence and prosecution removals for each trial. While this
variable is of minor importance for modelling the individual venire members, it is of major interest when viewing the trials
themselves. While counts of these strikes were provided in the data, there were many missing values, or values inconsistent with
the number of associated venire members in the data. For example, many of the recorded values in these columns were zero even when
venire members associated with that trial were marked as struck.

To remedy this, for each trial a number of variables were generated. Primarily, these variables were counts of the number of
venire members with particular characteristics which were struck by both the prosecution and defence in the trial. For example the
variable \texttt{DefRem.Race.Black} provided the count of black venire members struck by the defence. To provide an estimate of
the number of venire members removed by each strike source, these counts were summed for one particular variable, typically
gender. The sum was then compared to the recorded value for that party's removed count. The greater of the two values was
kept as an estimated count to be used in analysis. For both the prosecution and the defence, about 80\% of the sum and recorded
values matched exactly and about 18\% of the recorded values were less than the sum. This suggests some incompleteness for the
remaining 2--4\% of the data.

\subsection{Visualizing the Racial Trends} \label{subsec:vistrend}

\subsubsection{The Positional Boxplot}

Motivated by the plots in the \texttt{extracat} package in \Rp (\cite{extracat}), in particular the \texttt{rmb} plot, a
positional proportion plot, called here the ``positional boxplot,'' was developed to display the strike tendencies across
trials. The data for each trial consists of categorical variables and two integer counts corresponding to the estimated defence
and prosecution strike counts described in \ref{subsec:struckjur}. The positional boxplot was developed to investigate the
relationship between the strike patterns of both parties and the defendant race.

Therefore, the positional boxplot is designed to visualize the conditional distribution of a categorical variable given two
integer count variables. Each observation consists of a level of a categorical variable and two counts. Across the whole data,
there may be occurrences of identical values for the two counts. At each unique combination of integer counts observed, a box is
placed with an area proportional to the number of observations with that specific combination. Each box is then subdivided
horizontally such that the width of each subdivision is proportional to the corresponding count of each level of the categorical
variable that occurs with that specific integer combination.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \epsfCfile{0.7}{DefProStrikesTrial}
  \caption[Prosecution and Defence Strikes by Trial]{\footnotesize The positional boxplot of strikes by race of defendant for the
    Sunshine data. There does not seem to be a dependence of strike counts on the defendant race, the boxes look similar across
    the entire plot.}
  \label{fig:trialprodef}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:trialprodef} displays a positional boxplot of defendant race to prosecution and defence estimated strike
counts. While the internal box patterns look rather similar everywhere, split somewhat evenly between black and white defendants,
their areas are quite revealing. In the aggregate examination of the data, it was clear that the defence had an overal higher
strike rate than the prosecution, this effect can be viewed clearly in Figure \ref{fig:gengen} where the defence has a higher
strike rate across all gender combinations. What was not clear was whether this pattern reflected the typical pattern at the
individual trial level or was rather due outlier cases with abundant defence strikes. The areas of the boxes in Figure
\ref{fig:trialprodef} indicate clearly that the defence typically uses more peremptory challenges than the prosecution in each
trial.

Of course, the most striking result of the modelling from \ref{sec:mods} seen clearly in Figure \ref{fig:modselcoef} was the
dominance of the venire member race in determining their strike probabilities. Viewing the defendant race may simply be the wrong
plot. Breaking this apart to display the racial tendencies across trials for both the defence and prosecution could reveal
interesting patterns. Such a plot is shown in \ref{fig:defandpros}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}{0.7\textwidth}

  \end{subfigure}
  \caption[Racial Strike Pattern by Party]
  {\footnotesize Positional boxplot of racial strikes by defence and prosecution.}
  \label{fig:defandpros}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:defracestrike} shows the strong preference of the defence to strike white jurors regardless of the defendant
race. The tendency of the defence to strike jurors different than the defendant noted in \ref{sec:examcoef} is also visible in
this plot. Note how the black defendants generally make a greater proportion of the points for higher white venire strike
counts. In contrast, the opposite trend is shown in Figure \ref{fig:proracestrike}, where the boxes further to the left have a
greater proportion of black defendants and those moving up have a greater proportion of white defendants.

Interestingly, the prosecution also seems less biased than the defence at the trial level. The distribution of strikes seems
similar between both black and white venire members. Such an appearance, however, is misleading, because it fails to account for
the number of black and white venire members presented to the court. These numbers are very different, as can be seen by the
lengths of the horizontal black lines in Figure \ref{fig:racedefmob}. A sizeable majority of the venire members are
white. Luckily, with trial aggregated data, the raw strike counts can be normalized into proportions. The resulting scatterplots
of these proportions by trial are displayed in Figure \ref{fig:defproprop}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}{0.7\textwidth}
    \epsfCfile{1}{DefStrProp}
    \caption{\footnotesize Defence racial strike pattern}

  \end{subfigure}
  \caption[Racial Strike Proportions by Party]
  {\footnotesize Positional boxplot of racial strikes by defence and prosecution.}
  \label{fig:defproprop}
\end{figure}

Here, the prosecution and defence biases are much more clear. The prosecution never strikes more than 40\% of white venire members
presented, and on average strikes a greater proportion of the black venire than the white venire. The defence, in contrast,
regularly strikes more than 40\% of the white venire, and on average strikes a greater proportion of the white venire members than
the black venire members. This reinforces the aggregate observations made in \ref{sec:mods}, indicating that these mechanics
operate on the individual trial level, and not just over all trials. Additionally, the high variation visible in Figure
\ref{fig:defproprop} suggests that the aggregate patterns described in \ref{sec:mods} are not followed by all defence of
prosecution lawyers, merely on average.

While these differences are perhaps interesting, the far more interesting observation that can be gleaned from these plots is the
fundamental difference in inclusion of minority and majority groups in jury formation. The aggregate statistics indicate that the
black venire members are a minority, and Figure \ref{fig:defproprop} suggests that as a consequence, it is common that a majority
or all of the potential black jurors will be removed by peremptory challenge while such an occurrence is incredibly rare for the
majority white jurors, if not impossible. While in many trials all black venire members were struck, in not a single trial was
every white venire member struck. This suggests that if one had a strategy of keeping minorities off of juries, the peremptory
challenge system would make this task easier. Such an observation is obvious in theory, but it is no less striking to see it
emerge from the data.

\section{On Jury Selection}

\cite{vandykejurysel} spends much of chapters four and five exploring the causes for the underrepresentation of certain groups in
jury venires, and his analysis suggests that underrepresentation starts at the jury selection stage due to fewer non-white
individuals registering to vote generally (page 89), and the process of applying to be excused from jury duty, in which economic
hardship, which impacts disadvantaged economic groups to a greater extent (pages 113-120), is a common reason for excusal from
jury duty.

Such explanations provide a plausible reason why black males would be most underrepresented in venires, and why the majority of
the venire is white in this data despite the majority of defendants being black. Such issues with the jury selection process will
not, and cannot, be solved by simply removed the peremptory challenge. They have much more to do with the relationship between
certain groups and wider society, and so require more comprehensive and complex solutions.

The Gerald Stanley case serves as an excellent demonstration of this problem. As \cite{boushie750} report, 750 individuals on the
jury roll were sent court summons, but only 204 of these individuals appeared on the day of the trial. This large non-response
population introduces the potential for incredible bias in the venire that is to be used for selection. If there is some
relationship between demographics and an inability to serve on a jury or a lack of will to respond to a court summons, as
\cite{vandykejurysel} suggests with ample evidence, then problems with minority representaton may be due in larger part to the
method of jury summons than the exercise of challenges in the courtroom. Removing the peremptory challenge may serve as a useful
step in the right direction, but it cannot be expected to ``fix'' minority representation alone.
