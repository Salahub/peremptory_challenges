\chapter{Empirical Analysis} \label{c:analysis}

With this data cleaned and processed, questions can now be posed and addressed through analysis. A few obvious questions come to
mind, considering the previous work done on this subject and the modern controversy surrounding it. First, there is the obvious
question of not only the possible racial imbalance of peremptory challenge use, but how this imbalance changes with the race of
the defendant. In the Gerald Stanley trial, for example, the critical aspect of the trial was not the use of peremptory challenges
in abstract, but how their use interacted with the race of Stanley.

Aside from these investigations, we may wonder whether the most common arguments posed in favour of peremptory challenge are
satisfied in this data. As discussed in \ref{sec:roleper}, there are two primary arguments. The first is the argument that the
pereptory challenge is necessary to remove the ``extremes of partiality'' present in the venire for both sides, that is to remove
the most extremely biased jurors. This goal is complemented by the ability of the judge to remove jurors with cause, which is also
designed to remove those jurors with extreme bias. The second argument is the creation of a jury which is mutually acceptable to
both parties in the trial.

\section{Extremes of Partiality} \label{sec:extremes}

While creating a quantitative judgement on the acceptability of a jury is somewhat difficult, measuring the extremality or
abnormality of observations is a critical function of statistics. With this in mind, a very simple calculation was performed. The
central claim of the advocates of the use of peremptory challenge is that it is only used to remove extreme cases of bias. If that
is so, then the proportion of venire members removed by peremptory challenge should reflect this concept.

Of course, this cannot be rigorously tested, as there is no way of knowing the true distribution of bias among jurors. That does
not mean nothing can be said, however. As \cite{nisbett1985} notes, there is a tendency of people to guess that a distribution is
normal when asked to guess the distribution of social attitudes\footnote{This problem is not helped by the notoriety of the normal
  distribution, as it is commonly the distribution used when performing tests (likely due to the utility of the Central Limit
  Theorem) and generating visualizations of a general distribution}. Additionally, mathematical constraints such as the Chebyshev
inequality (see \cite{chebyshev}) provide an upper limit to the dispersion of any distribution.

This study suggests that it would not be unreasonable to view the overall causal and peremptory challenge rates as the tails of a
normal distribution, and the Chebyshev limit gives an estimate of the extremality of rejections given a maximally dispersed
distribution of opinions. Table \ref{tab:rejbounds} provides a summary of the rejection rates of the different data sets and the
implied standard distance from the centre that these imply for symmetric rejection.

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \label{tab:rejbounds}
  \caption[Implied Rejection Boundaries]{The implied statistical extremity bound for symmetric rejection in the datasets given
    different distributional assumptions}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
    Data & Rejection Rate & Normal & Chebyshev Limit \\ \hline
    Sunshine & 0.434 & 0.781 & 1.517 \\
    Stubborn & & & \\
    Philadelphia & & & \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Obviously, it is not possible to comment with authority on the presence of partiality in the population. Indeed, given the large
divide that appears to be present politically in the United States and the rest of the Western world today, it may be easier to
argue for a maximally spread distribution than a centralized one. Regardless of this difficulty, it is difficult to justify that
43\% of a dataset is ``extreme'' statistically. In the normal case, this suggests that the rejection boundary is less than one
standard deviation from the mean, i.e. that the typically sampled point will be too extreme. The Chebyshev limit is not much
better, suggesting that the rejection boundary is at most 1.5 standard deviations from the mean in either direction.

This low rejection boundary given any distribution suggests that the peremptory challenge is not simply being used to remove
``extremes of partiality.'' Rather, it seems that the argument used to support and justify the practice cannot be reconciled well
with the data, suggesting systemic over-use relative to its supported use. This leads naturally to the question of how exactly
this legal instrument is over-used, and why.

\section{The Impact of Race} \label{sec:impactrace}

The racially-motivated controversy surrounding peremptory provide one possible route to investigate the pattern of peremptory
strike over-use. To begin, a simple marginal investigation was performed to explore the impact of the simplified race on the
peremptory strike probability. The result of this investigation is displayed in Table \ref{tab:margrace}. Of particular interest
is whether any race is far more likely to be struck by peremptory challenge than the others, as this might suggest that race is
the target of the over-use of strikes.

\begin{table}
  \label{tab:margrace}
  \centering
  \caption[Strike Rate by Race]{The conditional probability of a venire member being struck peremptorily by the simplified venire
    member race across data sets}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|} \hline
    Data & Black & Other & White \\ \hline
    Sunshine & 0.23 & 0.24 & 0.25 \\ 
    Stubborn &  & & \\ 
    Philadelphia & & & \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

The differences in these probabilities are significant in the Sunshine data at $\alpha = 0.05$ by merit its size, but an effect
size of 2\% is hardly relevant if one considers that the size of each empanelled jury is typically only 12. Moreover, the average
number of venire members which is interviewed to create the jury is only 19. Perhaps there is a more interesting relationship
present at the racial level. Taking inspiration from \textit{Swain v. Alabama}, \textit{Batson v. Kentucky}, and
\textit{R. v. Stanley}, perhaps viewing the relationship between venire member race and defendant race would be informative. This
relationship is displayed in Figure \ref{fig:racedefmob}.

\begin{figure}[!h]

  \epsfCfile{0.7}{RaceParCoord}
  \caption[The ``Mobile Plot'' of Racial Combination and Strikes]{The conditional probability of successful challenges given the
    venire member and defendant race, with the expected value represented by the horizontal black line, and the observed values
    represented by the point at the end of the dotted line. Each horizontal black line corresponds to a particular venire member
    and defendant race combination, with a length proportional to the number of venire members with that combination. The dashed
    vertical lines, coloured by challenge source, start at these horizontal lines and end at points which show the observed
    probability of a challenge by that source for the given racial combination.}
  \label{fig:racedefmob}
\end{figure}

A detailed description of this plot and its development which includes a discussion of the principles of graphics and perception
which were used to devise its form is presented in \ref{app:devmob}\footnote{Here it suffices to mention that much of its design
  was motivated by the philosophy of \cite{VisualDisplayQuant} and the results of \cite{cleveland1987} on the accuracy of visual
  perception}. Instead, the most interesting patterns visible in the plot with bee discussed here.

First, a small explanation of the plot. The plot displays the relationship between three categorical variables: venire member
race, defendant race, and disposition (whether a venire member is struck and by whom). The vertical axis corresponds to the
conditional probability of the disposition given a race and defendant race combination. Racial combinations are placed along the
horizontal axis, and each combination corresponds to one horizontal black line in the plotting area. The length of these lines is
proportional to the number of venire members in the data with the corresponding racial combination, and their vertical positions
are the mean conditional probability of a venire member being removed by a challenge for that particular combination. The dashed
vertical lines, coloured by disposition, start at this mean line and extend to the observed conditional probability of the
corresponding disposition for the relevant racial combination. As a consequence, this plot can be viewed as a visualization of the
test of a specific hypothesis:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:vishyp}
  D | R_{VM}, R_{D} \sim Unif(\{1,2,3\})
\end{equation}

Where $D, R_{VM}, R_D$ are random variables representing the disposition, venire member race, and defedant race respectively. In
words: the conditional distribution of the disposition given the racial combination is uniform. This implies that all
three strikes occur with the same probability for each racial combination, though they may differ between racial
combinations. Such a hypothesis allows for certain racial combinations to experience a higher strike rate generally, but
constrains the strike rate to be the same for all parties, which would imply that all parties in the court pursue an identical
strike strategy across all venire member and defendant race combinations.

Clearly, Figure \ref{fig:racedefmob} casts some doubt on this hypothesis. Determining with greater precision the particular
departures from the expected pattern cannot be accomplished with that figure alone, however. Some incorporation of the variation
one expects from each observed value is required. This is accomplished by the addition of approximate 95\%  multinomial confidence
intervals using the \texttt{MultinomialCI} package in \Rp, which implements multinomial confidence intervals following the method
presented in \cite{sison1995}. These confidence intervals for the conditional probabilities can be seen in Figure
\ref{fig:racedefci}.

\section{Case Level Summary} \label{sec:casesum}

While \cite{JurySunshineProj} reported a great deal of aggregate statistics about the venire members themselves, one piece of
investigation which was lacking was an analysis which aggregated and viewed the trends for the cases, rather than simply for
individual venire members. As we cannot know why a potential venire member is struck individually, and viewing their aggregate
statistics tells us nothing about how different strikes relate to each other, it is possible we are viewing some effect which is
not a result of persistent bias across trials, but is rather the result of some other effect.

By aggregating the venire members by trial and viewing the demographic trends in strikes and behaviour at this level, we gain a
more detailed insight into the impact of challenges at a more relevant scale. Additionally, such aggregation allows for the
synthesis of certain measures, such as a disitributional difference via the Kullback-Leibler divergence (\cite{kullback1951}),
which would otherwise not be well defined. This particular perspective of the data has also not been explored by any other studies
known to the author.

\section{Modelling} \label{sec:mods}

In order to create a single model to test the statistical significance of the differences observed for strike rates by race,
defendant race, and party doing the striking, a saturated poisson regression model was fit to the data. Letting $i$ denote the
level of the venire member race, $j$ the defendant race, and $k$ the disposition, the numbers of observed venire members in each
$ijk$ combination, $y_{ijk}$ were modelled as Poisson-distributed random variables with expectation $\lambda_{ijk}$. A saturated
model was then fit to the data, that is a model described by the equation:

\begin{multline}
  \log{E[y_{ijk}]} = \textbf{x}_{ijk}\beta = \beta_o + \beta_R x_{i..}  + \beta_{D} x_{.j.} + \beta_S x_{..k} +\beta_{R:D}x_{i..}
  x_{.j.} + \beta_{R:S} x_{i..} x_{..k} +\beta_{D:S} x_{.j.}x_{..k} \\+ \beta_{R:D:S} x_{i..} x_{.j.} x_{..k}
\end{multline}

Where $x_{i..}$ indicates the race level of the $ijk$ cell, and $x_{.j.},x_{..k}$ are defined analogously for the defendant race
and disposition. The interaction terms then serve to answer questions about the racial pattern of strikes which is utilized by
each party given the defendant race. Most interesting to this investigation is the third order interaction term. This term
indicates a significant difference in racial strike patterns given the party striking and the defendant race. In other words, this
term accounts for different patterns for the different parties which are not independant of the defendant race.

While this second tendency seems to have no justification beyond race, the dominant tendency may have other justification than
simply skin colour. As was noted by ``Ideological Imbalance and Peremptory Challenge'', black individuals are more consistently
aligned with the democratic party, and as a consequence a lawyer which suspects this political bias will impact the trial outcome
would preferentially strike or keep black jurors in order to keep as many left wing individuals as possible. In this data, this
political imbalance is incredibly prevalent, as can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:racepolitics} \textcolor{red}{Add the plot of this
  effect here, elaborate on this pattern more based on the plot}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \epsfCfile{0.7}{RaceGenderPolit}
  \caption[Political Affiliation by Race and Gender (Sunshine)]
  {Conditional probabilities of political affiliation by race and gender} 
  \label{fig:racepolitics}
\end{figure}

Perhaps more interestingly, the prosecution and judge seem to match in their tendency from the mean at every combination. This
suggests that both challenges with cause and the prosecution tend to have the same effect on the jury composition, though the
magnitudes can differ greatly for these two strikes. An immediate explanation to this is offered by \cite{hansvidjudging}, who
outline, on pages 69-70, the skill and tact required to effectively propose challenges with cause. In order to determine an
individual's bias, it is frequently the case that a direct question will fail to garner an honest reponse due to social pressures.
As a consequence, the questions asked of venire members must be carefully presented.

Using this as a motivation, an obvious possible explanation for the challenges with cause is that the prosecution is simply more
experienced on average than the defence. To determine the veracity of this claim, the year licensed for each lawyer was
subtracted from the outcome date of each trial. The resulting distribution of years of experience was then plotted in back-to-back
histograms as shown in Figure \ref{fig:lawyerexp}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \epsfCfile{.7}{LawyerExp}

  \caption[Lawyer Experience (Sunshine)]
  {Distributions of lawyer experience for prosecutors and defence attorneys}
  \label{fig:lawyerexp}
\end{figure}

Clearly, this hypothesis is false. It seems the typical defence lawyer is more experienced than the typical prosecutor, not
less. Indeed, the prosecutors seem to be much more likely to be inexperienced than the defence lawyers.

\section{Useful Quoted Bits}

\cite{vandykejurysel} spends much of chapters four and five exploring the causes for the underrepresentation of certain groups in
jury venires, and his analysis suggests that underrepresentation starts at the jury selection stage due to fewer non-white
individuals registering to vote generally (page 89), and the process of applying to be excused from jury duty, in which economic
hardship, which impacts disadvantaged economic groups to a greater extent (pages 113-120), is a common reason for excusal from
jury duty.

Such explanations provide a plausible reason why black males would be most underrepresented in venires, and why the majority of
the venire is white in this data despite the majority of defendants being black. Such issues with the jury selection process will
not, and cannot, be solved by simply removed the peremptory challenge. They have much more to do with the relationship between
certain groups and wider society, and so require more comprehensive and complex solutions.
