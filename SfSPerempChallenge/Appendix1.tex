\section{Prosecution and Judge Homogeneity} \label{sec:causepro}

As noted in \ref{sec:impactrace}, the prosecution and judge seem to match in their strike tendencies for every combination. This
suggests that both challenges with cause and the prosecution tend to have the same effect on the jury composition, though the
magnitudes can differ greatly for these two strikes. An immediate explanation to this is offered by \cite{hansvidjudging}, who
outline, on pages 69-70, the skill and tact required to effectively propose challenges with cause. In order to determine an
individual's bias, it is frequently the case that a direct question will fail to garner an honest reponse due to social pressures.
As a consequence, the questions asked of venire members must be carefully presented.

Using this as a motivation, an obvious possible explanation for the challenges with cause is that the prosecution is simply more
experienced on average than the defence. To determine the veracity of this claim, the licensing year of each lawyer was subtracted
from the outcome date of each trial. The resulting distribution of years of experience was then plotted in back-to-back histograms
as shown in Figure \ref{fig:lawyerexp}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \epsfCfile{.5}{LawyerExp}

  {\footnotesize Distributions of lawyer experience for prosecutors and defence attorneys}
  \label{fig:lawyerexp}
\end{figure}

Clearly, this hypothesis is not supported by the data. It seems the typical defence lawyer is more experienced than the typical
prosecutor, not less. Indeed, the prosecutors seem to be much more likely to be inexperienced than the defence lawyers. This
suggests that the cause of this matching departure from the expected independent hypothesis has some different cause. Future
investigation may endeavour to answer this question.
