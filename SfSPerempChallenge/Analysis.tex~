\chapter{Analysis} \label{c:analysis}

With this data cleaned and processed, questions can now be posed and addressed through analysis. A few obvious questions come to
mind, considering the previous work done on this subject. The first is whether the results found by previous analyses which did
not use statistics are statistically significant. Additionally, we may wonder whether the most common arguments posed in favour of
peremptory challenge are satisfied in this data.

\section{Arguments for Peremptory Challenges} \label{sec:leveling}

The primary argument stated in favour of the continued use of peremptory challenges is that of the 'levelling' of the bias of the
jury. \textcolor{red}{Cite Canadian news articles here} The argument, essentially states that peremptory challenges are necesary
to remove those jurors which are somehow abnormally biased but which are not eligible for removal by cause, or have not been
removed by cause out of error.

While the argument of recourse for an incorrect judgement of a challenge with cause is certainly valid, it seems unnecessary in
light of the appeals process which already exists. Regardless, a precise comment on the validity of this statement cannot be
easily made. The second assertion, however, permits a precise and straightforward mathematical analysis.

In the Jury Sunshine data, for example, the proportion of venire members rejected by peremptory challenge is roughly 0.43. In what
sense can such a large proportion of the venire be judged as extreme?

A secondary argument is that of the creation of a jury which is mutually acceptable by giving both sides the privilege of removing
any jurors they do not want assessing their case. The multiple American supreme court cases which address peremptory challenges
and the outcome of the Gerald Stanley murder trial demonstrate quite clearly that this noble goal is not executed in
practice. Rather, the privilege is a point of weakness that allows the politicization cases by doing the precise opposite of what
it purports to achieve. It creates juries which are unacceptable to one party and society at large.

\section{Modelling} \label{sec:mods}

In order to create a single model to test the statistical significance of the differences observed for strike rates by race,
defendant race, and party doing the striking, a saturated poisson regression model was fit to the data. Letting $i$ denote the
level of the venire member race, $j$ the defendant race, and $k$ the disposition, the numbers of observed venire members in each
$ijk$ combination, $y_{ijk}$ were modelled as Poisson-distributed random variables with expectation $\lambda_{ijk}$. A saturated
model was then fit to the data, that is a model described by the equation:

\begin{multline}
  \log{E[y_{ijk}]} = \textbf{x}_{ijk}\beta = \beta_o + \beta_R x_{i..}  + \beta_{D} x_{.j.} + \beta_S x_{..k} +\beta_{R:D}x_{i..}
  x_{.j.} + \beta_{R:S} x_{i..} x_{..k} +\beta_{D:S} x_{.j.}x_{..k} \\+ \beta_{R:D:S} x_{i..} x_{.j.} x_{..k}
\end{multline}

Where $x_{i..}$ indicates the race level of the $ijk$ cell, and $x_{.j.},x_{..k}$ are defined analogously for the defendant race
and disposition. The interaction terms then serve to answer questions about the racial pattern of strikes which is utilized by
each party given the defendant race. Most interesting to this investigation is the third order interaction term. This term
indicates a significant difference in racial strike patterns given the party striking and the defendant race. In other words, this
term accounts for different patterns for the different parties which are not independant of the defendant race.

When this term is tested using a nested model without the third order interaction, the third order interaction is found to be
significant. This suggests that not only do the patterns present in the different parties vary, but they vary differently for
different defendant races. This dependence can be viewed using a novel graphic presented in Figure \ref{fig:raceraceparcoord}.
