\chapter*{Abstract}

The legal practice of peremptory challenges is described, outlining its past and present racial controversies as well as defences
provided in its favour. These defenses are analyzed statistically, and novel visual tools including the mobile plot and the
positional boxplot are developed to explore three data sets (\cite{JurySunshineProj}, \cite{StubbornLegacy}, and
\cite{PerempChalMurder}) and test whether race is a determining factor in peremptory challenge exercise. Mulitnomial regression
models motivated by these visualizations are fit and used to generate precise parameter estimates which indicate the dominance of
race in peremptory challenge decisions. Trial level summaries are produced and discussed.
