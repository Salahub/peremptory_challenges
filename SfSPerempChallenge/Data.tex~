\subsection{Sunshine Data}

The data collected in North Carolina proved invaluable to this project \cite{JurySunshineProj}.

\underline{Problem}: some columns of the data contained only NA values
\underline{Solution}: \texttt{lapply} to remove these uninformative columns

\underline{Problem}: relational database provided did not have all data in one joined table
\underline{Solution}: creation of \texttt{CleaningMerge} function: a wrapper for \texttt{merge} which provides information about the
mismatches which may be present in the two merged tables

\underline{Problem}: inconsistently coded levels, e.g. inconsistent case or ``?'' instead of ``U'' for unknowns
\underline{Solution}: forcing levels to be uppercase and the replacement of obvious mis-specified levels

\underline{Problem}: some columns seem to have swapped values, e.g. the gender column should be one of ``M'', ``F'', or ``U'' and the
political affiliation column should be one of ``D'', ``R'', ``I'', or ``U'', but some individuals have the gender recorded as
``R'' and political affiliation as ``M''
\underline{Solution}: the creation of the \texttt{IdentifySwap} function, which has two arguments: a data set and the acceptable or correct
levels for the variables in the data set. It then identifies rows which have candidate swaps and presents them for review
