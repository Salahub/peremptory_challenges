\chapter{Developing an Effective Visualization of Conditional Probability} \label{app:devmob}

One deficiency of the results of the previous investigations was a failure to generate compelling and effective visualizations of
the trends of peremptory challenges for different racial groups. While such visualizations are not necessarily critical to
analysis, they can often be incredibly useful to not only communicate data, but to motivate further investigations and models in a
way which is clearer and more intuitive than a simple table of values.

The first attempt at such a visualization was the mosaic plot (as discussed by \cite{friendly1994}) using the \texttt{mosaicplot}
function in the \texttt{graphics} package in \Rp (\cite{Rcite}). Figure \ref{fig:mosaicdefrace} displays this first approach with
disposition related to the simplified races of both the defendant and the venire member.

    their relation to the disposition of the venire member.}
  \label{fig:mosaicdefrace}
\end{figure}

This visualization suffers from a number of limitations, some of which are obvious, and others of which are best explained by
the hierarchy of accuracy of visual perception provided in \cite{cleveland1987}. The obvious limitations are the lack of ability
to perceive the differences for the smallest groups, which are compressed enough that their error is nearly
imperceptible. Additionally, the ordering of the axes is incredibly important in how the different areas appear visually, and
comparing the different areas is unclear if any specific comparisons are to be made.

This may be somewhat unsurprising. \cite{cleveland1987}, in their ranking of visual displays by accuracy of perception place area
low in the hierarchy, below angles, lengths, and positions along common scales. In \textit{The Visual Display of Quantitative
  Information}, \citeauthor{VisualDisplayQuant} gives two more sources of possible criticism of the mosaic plot as displayed in
Figure \ref{fig:mosaicdefrace}: the concept of data-ink and the dimensionality of visualization.

Of the mosaic plot, one may ask how much of the ``ink'', or structure, on the page is necessary to communicate the information
present. If one has a desire to ``above all else show the data'' as Tufte does, then these large shaded rectangles, which are
likely not perceived accurately according to \citeauthor{cleveland1987}, seem unnecessary compared to a simpler
visualization. This is the concept of ``data-ink,'' to reduce the complexity of the structures and chart used to display the
data.

Hand-in-hand with this concept for this plot is \citeauthor{VisualDisplayQuant}'s rule that the dimensionality of the
visualization should not be larger than the data. In the case of the mosaic plot this is not strictly violated, as the marginal
lengths used to create the areas reflect a measurement of the data. Nonetheless, the areas of each rectangle correspond to a
simple count in a contingency table, and perhaps an area is not the best way to represent such a singular value.

    display and unclear definition of the axis make interpretation even less intuitive than the mosaic plot, suggesting that this
    first attempt was a decided failure.}
  \label{fig:firstparcoord}
\end{figure}

Motivated by these concepts, parallel coordinates (as in \cite{wegman1990}) were used to visualize the data next, as can be seen
in Figure \ref{fig:firstparcoord}. This attempted visualization is arguably more difficult to interpret than the mosaic plot. It
is cluttered by the parallel coordinate lines, the bars emanating from each point obscure the fact that the end point of the bar
is the only feature of interest, and the meaning of the black reference line is entirely unclear without extensive
explanation. Finally, by viewing the distribution of each disposition, the wrong conditional density is being examined,
$P(Race,Race Defendant|Disposition)$. Multiple edits and re-conceptualizations of the concept eventually resulted in Figure
\ref{fig:raceparcoord}, which will be called the ``mobile plot'' due to its passing resemblance to the mobiles hung above babies'
cribs.

An explanation of the features and encoding used in the mobile plot is presented in \ref{subsec:mobile}.

    than either the mosaic plot or the first parallel coordinate plot, despite displaying more information. It is also more
    efficient with data-ink, avoids displaying data with higher dimensions that the data itself, and uses redundant encoding of
    information in visual cues which are high in the hierarchy presented by \cite{cleveland1987}.}

\section{The Mobile Plot} \label{:mobile}

The mobile plot consists of multiple grouped vertical lines anchored at one end to horizontal black lines, and at the other to
points. Information is encoded using length, colour, and position relative to a common scale. The vertical axis is meant to show
the value of a continuous variable, while the horizontal axis shows the value of a, possibly grouped, categorical variable. It can
be used to display the relationship between three categorical variables and a continuous variable in a meaningful two-dimensional
plot.

To show the grouping of categories on the horizontal axis, position is used. Those categorical levels which are grouped by some
separate categorical variable are placed closer to each other than those which are not in the same group. Each categorical level
