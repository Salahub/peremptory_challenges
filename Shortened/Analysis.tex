\section{Analysis} \label{c:analysis}

The \R code used to perform the analysis and generate all

\subsection{Visualization} \label{sec:visual}

First, consider the simple unconditional probabilities of
removal by peremptory challenge by race in all data sets, shown in
Table \ref{tab:margrace}. These probabilities are different, but not greatly so. Indeed, the trend of higher probabilities for the removal of white jurors
across all data sets is perhaps counter-intuitive given the history of controversy in the United States. In any case, the small
magnitude of these differences suggests only a weak racial bias at the aggregate level.

\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \caption[Strike Rate by Race]{\footnotesize The conditional probability of a venire member being struck peremptorily by venire member race across data sets. Note that the Philadelphia trial data only
    indicated black and non-black venire members and so only two numbers can be reported.} \label{tab:margrace}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c c c|} \hline
    \textit{Data} & \textit{Black} & \textit{Other} & \textit{White} \\ \hline
    Sunshine & 0.23 & 0.24 & 0.25 \\

    Philadelphia & 0.67 & \multicolumn{2}{c|}{0.68} \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

This table also demonstrates some of the drawbacks of tables, the
dominant method used to display data in the literature. The table, while excellent at communicating specific
values, does not provide a sense of trends or patterns without careful
engagement by the reader (\cite{tukeywilk1966}.) A critical component of the
communication of any analysis and its comparison to others is the ability to quickly and effectively discern patterns in the data. Consequently, the ``mobile plot'' for visualizing the three-way relationships of categorical variables was
developed, with motivation from the hierarchy of visual perception of
(\cite{cleveland1987}) and inspiration from
(\cite{VisualDisplayQuant}). It is used in Figure \ref{fig:racedefmob}
to compare the strike dispositions of venire members by their race and the defendant race for the Sunshine data.

\begin{figure}[!h]

  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{RaceParCoord}
  \caption[The ``Mobile Plot'' of Strikes by Racial Combination (Sunshine)]{\footnotesize The conditional probability of strike disposition given the
    venire member and defendant race for the Sunshine data set. Expected values are represented by the horizontal black lines, and the observed values
    by the points at the end of the dotted lines. Each horizontal black line corresponds to a particular venire member
    and defendant race combination, with a length proportional to the number of venire members with that combination. The dashed
    vertical lines, coloured by challenge source, start at these horizontal lines and end at points which show the observed
    probability of a venire member being struck by the indicated party for the given racial combination.}
  \label{fig:racedefmob}
\end{figure}

First, a small explanation of the mobile plot. This mobile plot displays the relationship between three categorical variables:
venire member race, defendant race, and disposition (whether a venire member is struck and how). The vertical axis corresponds
to the conditional probability of a particular disposition given a racial combination. Racial combinations
are placed along the horizontal axis, and each combination corresponds to one horizontal black line in the plotting area. The
length of these lines is proportional to the number of venire members in the data with the corresponding racial combination, and
their vertical positions are the mean conditional probability of a
venire member being struck for that particular combination. The dashed
vertical lines, coloured by disposition, start at these mean lines and
extend to the observed conditional probability of the corresponding disposition for the relevant racial combination. As a
consequence, this plot can be viewed as a visualization of the test of a specific hypothesis:

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:vishyp}
  D | D \neq \text{Kept}, R, E \sim Unif(\{\text{Prosecution
    Struck, Defence Struck, Struck with Cause}\})
\end{equation}

Where $D, R, E$ are random variables representing the disposition, venire member race, and defendant race, respectively. In words: the conditional distribution of the
disposition given the racial combination of a struck venire member is
uniform. This implies that strikes with cause, defence peremptory
strikes, and prosecution peremptory strikes occur with the same probability for each
racial combination, though the rate may differ between racial
combinations. In other words, the hypothesis is that all parties in the court pursue an identical strike strategy across all venire member and defendant race
combinations.

Clearly, Figure \ref{fig:racedefmob} casts some doubt on this hypothesis. While the horizontal black lines tell a very similar
story to Table \ref{tab:margrace}, with little variation between them
except in small population subsets, a number of other
striking patterns are visible. The first and most obvious of these is
the main effect of venire member race, where it is clear that the defence and prosecution pursue
radically different strategies. The defence seems biased towards a jury composed of more racial minorities. All
orange points are below the horizontal lines for the black and other venire members, indicating these groups are less likely to be
struck by the defence than expected, while the points are above the lines for the white venire members, indicating a higher than
expected probability of a defence strike. The prosecution seems to mirror this tendency, striking the
white venire members at a lower rate than expected and the black venire members more often than expected. Challenges with cause
seem to show less deviation from expectation for the black and white venire members, and always deviate from expectation
in the same direction as the prosecution.

The addition of defendant races shows another interesting trend. It would seem that the aforementioned tendencies of the
prosecution and defence are strongest for black defendants, which have the greatest departures of the conditional probabilities
from the expectation. The defence and prosecution seem to have slightly more similar habits when the defendant is white, despite
their opposite tendencies in all cases. Finally, it would seem that strikes with cause follow patterns similar to the
prosecution, as the corresponding points always fall on the 
same side of the expected line, an event which would occur with probability $2^{-9} \approx 0.002$ under the hypothesis of
independent uniform strike rates. Section \ref{sec:mods} discusses the agreement of these two strike tendencies further.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{RaceDefCI}
  \caption[Strikes by Racial Combination with Confidence
  Intervals (Sunsine)]{\footnotesize The plot of conditional strike probability by racial
    combination from Figure \ref{fig:racedefmob} with confidence intervals added. Note that many of the seemingly striking departures seen are
    insignificant when these confidence intervals are applied,
    especially for races other than black and white.}
  \label{fig:racedefci}
\end{figure}

While Figure \ref{fig:racedefmob} is quite suggestive, the widths of certain horizontal black lines, in particular those for
venire members with a race other than white or black, suggest that some of the more extreme tendencies are simply a result
of the greater variation of small samples. In order to see the true nature of the noted departures some
incorporation of the expected variation is required. This is accomplished by the addition of
approximate 95\% simultaneous multinomial confidence intervals using the \texttt{MultinomialCI} package in \R, which implements
simultaneous confidence intervals for multinomial proportions following the method presented in (\cite{sison1995}). These confidence
intervals can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:racedefci}.

As suspected, some of the results for the smaller sample sizes do not seem to be significant. However, the results for the larger groups,
in particular for white venire members or black defendants, are significant. It should be noted that these simultaneous
confidence intervals do not constitute a proper statistical test of the impact of race, but instead
provide the viewer some sense of the expected variability in the data over repeated sampling. More rigorous testing requires
controlling for the impact of confounding factors, as done by the modelling in Section \ref{sec:mods}.

\subsubsection{In the Stubborn and Philadelphia Data}

  \label{fig:racedefalldata}
\end{figure}

Already the utility of the mobile plot, and visualizations of the data in general, should be clear. A wealth of information is
displayed very simply in Figure \ref{fig:racedefci}. However, the real power of this plot comes with the ability to quickly
compare different data sets. Consider, for example, comparing all three data sets
using Table \ref{tab:margrace}. In order to compare, the rows for each data set must be viewed and the numbers
committed to memory before the reader moves to the appropriate row to compare values. While the simple four row and three column
structure of this particular table make this rather straightforward,
it becomes more difficult as the table grows
in complexity. Compare this with a cursory glance at Figure \ref{fig:racedefalldata}, which makes the similarities of the data
sets immediately clear despite the more detailed information
represented. Note that the less detailed racial measurements in the Philadelphia data make these plots considerably different than Figure \ref{fig:racedefci}.

Despite the different study populations of these three data sets, all display similar patterns, with only the
magnitudes of the strike rates differing. The mobile plot reveals several interesting aspects. The similar level of all black lines within each plot shows that in each data set, the aggregate probability of removal is
similar across racial combinations, as was implied by Table \ref{tab:margrace}. However, these aggregate similarities
hide the vastly and consistently different strategies of the defence and prosecution across all data sets. The defence has a
tendency to retain black venire members, striking them at a lower rate
than the other venire members, while the
prosecution shows a pattern which mirrors that of the defence,
removing more black venire members and fewer other venire members. In
all data sets the gap between these probabilities and the expected strike rates are greatest for the black venire members in cases
with black defendants.

It should be noted that the Sunshine data set looks most unique of the three, and this may be a result of the sampling method. While
the Philadelphia data and Stubborn data both collected data which included multiple years and selected capital cases only, the Sunshine data was restricted to
trials which occurred in 2011 and collected all cases. This small sample is the reason for the large confidence intervals present in Figure
\ref{fig:suncomp}. This does not explain the overall lower strike rate observed in the capital trials in the Sunshine data, which is also
visible in Table \ref{tab:margrace}. This departure may be of interest for future investigation.

\subsection{Modelling} \label{sec:mods}

Of course, it would be incorrect to conclude immediately that the cause of the racial patterns observed across these data sets is
race itself. A plethora of attitudes associated with race could serve as legitimate cause for a peremptory
challenge, as noted by Justice Byron R. White in the majority opinion in \textit{Swain v. Alabama} (\cite{swainvalabama}).

Without detailed transcripts detailing voire dire, it cannot be known if the aggregate pattern of removal is the result of racially based strikes, or whether the lawyers
determined valid reasons for a peremptory challenge related to race. Striking a venire member due to their political affiliation, for example, would be allowed, and so racial heterogeneity could cause valid strikes to appear invalid. Such an ``ideological imbalance'' in racial political affiliations is actually present in this data set, and has been noted elsewhere in the literature (\cite{revesz2016}).

Consequently, answering the question of peremptory strike validity precisely requires that all available confounding factors be controlled. While such controlled modelling has already been completed for (\cite{StubbornLegacy}) and (\cite{PerempChalMurder}), no such modelling has been completed for the much richer and larger Jury Sunshine data set. The design of the mobile plot further motivates such multivariate regression by suggesting a particular form of model: the multinomial logistic regression model.

\subsubsection{Multinomial Logistic Regression}

The mobile plot used in Figure \ref{fig:racedefmob} displays the
conditional distribution of a categorical variable with multiple
levels given some combination of other variables. The natural model to
complement this plot, then, would be a conditional multinomial
model. Consequently, a multinomial log-linear regression
model was fit to the data. The specific implementation of multinomial regression utilized was the
\texttt{multinom} function in the \texttt{nnet} package in \R, which implements a method of fitting multinomial logistic regression models discussed
in (\cite{nnet}).

For all models, the pivot outcome chosen was the probability of a
venire member sitting on the final jury, in other words the probability their disposition was coded as \texttt{Kept}. Coefficients were
then estimated using treatment contrasts against a black female venire member with Democrat voting tendencies in a case with a black female
defendant. While the choice of race, gender, and political affiliation for the reference level was not deliberate, the choice of pivot outcome, that of a venire member being kept, was made in order to make the visualizations of model coefficients easily compared to previous visualizations. Choosing another pivot would have hidden its effect as the intercept, making comparison more complicated.

The mobile plots created in \ref{sec:visual} suggest two main features
to investigate: the impact of venire member race in peremptory
challenge use and the interaction between race and
defendant race. Therefore a model of venire member race, political affiliation,
gender, defendent gender, defendant race, and an interaction effect
between venire member race and defendant race, called the full model,
was fit. To test the interaction and race effects in the presence of
all other variables, nested models excluding the interaction and excluding venire member race were also fit, called reduced models 1 and 2 respectively. The deviance residuals of all three models were used to perform ANOVA tests comparing the models. These can be see in Table \ref{tab:modcomp}, which compares the deviances of the different models sequentially when fit to the Sunshine data.

\begin{table}[h!]
  \centering
  \caption[Nested ANOVA Table Demonstrating the Importance of
  Race]{\footnotesize Comparison of models, displaying the residual deviance, residual degrees of freedom, differences, and p-values of these
    differences for adjacent models.}
  \label{tab:modcomp}
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|c|} \hline
    \textit{Model} & \textit{Residual df} & \textit{Residual Deviance} & \textit{Difference} & $P(\chi^2)$ \\ \hline
    Reduced Model 2 & 55527 & 39496 &  &  \\
    Reduced Model 1 & 55521 & 39087 & 405 & ~0 \\
    Full Model & 55509 & 39023 & 67 & 1.4e-9 \\ \hline
  \end{tabular}
\end{table}

Even when controlling for defendant characteristics and the venire member's political affiliation and sex, the race of the venire
member and its interaction with the defendant race are both highly significant at the $\alpha = 0.05$ level. This suggests that
the rejection of venire members is, at least in part, based on their racial characteristics. Note that the residual deviance values indicate that this model
is underdispersed, implying that the significant test results gained
are conservative.

Due to its significance compared to the other models, the full model was taken as the final model to estimate the race effects
with precision. Inspired by the dot-whisker plot (\cite{dotwhisker}), a custom dot-whisker plot was designed to display the model coefficients. This plot displays the coefficient estimates as points in the centre of a line, the endpoints of which
give the associated confidence intervals. A vertical line is placed at zero to provide a reference for the sign and significance
of different parameters. Modifying this concept to suit the multinomial regression data required grouping
the different possible outcomes for each parameter spatially. The estimated coefficients for the different effects and their approximate 95\% confidence intervals, calculated using the standard errors of the coefficients and a normal assumption, are displayed using this modified dot-whisker plot in Figure \ref{fig:modallcoef}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{AllModCoef}
  \caption[All Model Coefficients]{\footnotesize Model coefficients from the full model displayed using
    a dot-whisker plot. The lines indicate the confidence intervals while the central points indicate the point estimates of
    coefficients.}

\end{figure}

%\begin{figure}[h!]

%    plot. The lines indicate the confidence intervals while the central points indicate the point estimates of coefficients.}
%  \label{fig:modselcoef}
%\end{figure}

The first noteworthy feature of this plot is the position of the
coefficient estimates relative to the black line at zero. A
coefficient to the right of the black line indicates that the factor
corresponding to the coefficient increases the probability of the
venire member disposition and a coefficient to the left indicates that the presence of said factor decreases the
probability of the venire member disposition. The pattern of positive and negative values suggests the racial patterns
noticed in the mobile plots were not the result of confounding with any recorded variables.

The variables which show the greatest significance and the characteristic
oppositional tendencies of the prosecution and defence seen in Figure \ref{fig:racedefmob} are all race variables. White venire members, white
defendants, and the interaction of white venire members and white defendants
all have significant impacts on the probability of a venire member's
removal by peremptory challenge. Furthermore, the prosecution and
defence display opposite tendencies for these racial aspects and
the magnitude of the defence coefficients is consistently greater than
the prosecution for the race variables. This suggests that, on
average, the defence is more sensitive to the racial aspects of the
trial than the prosecution in the Sunshine data.

A quick survey of the prosecution peremptory challenge and challenge with cause coefficients shows far less agreement than seemed apparent in the mobile
plots. Scanning from the top to the bottom, the cause coefficients match the prosecution for a few groups, but are generally
different and often more similar to the defence than the prosecution. The suggestive pattern of matching prosecution strikes
and causal strikes viewed in Figure \ref{fig:racedefmob} vanishes when controls are placed on possible confounders. In general, the cause strike
coefficients are lower in magnitude than both the prosecution and defence, with the notable exception of the effect for male
defendants, where it is significantly greater than both.

There are a number of more nuanced patterns present as well. Note that
more venire members were kept than rejected in the Sunshine data, and so the
negative intercept for all strikes is expected. More intriguing are the large differences
between the different strike intercepts. These suggest that all three
strikes are used differently in the pivot case, that of a female, black,
Democrat venire member in a case with a female, black
defendant. Crucially, the defence intercept is smaller than the prosecution, matching what was observed in Figure \ref{fig:racedefmob}, where the lowest defence strike
probability occurred for black venire members in cases with black
defendants. 

The coefficients for white venire members also match the expectations of Figure \ref{fig:racedefmob}. The defence attains its
largest positive coefficient for white venire members and the prosecution its
largest negative coefficient, suggesting white venire members in cases
with black defendants are the most polarizing. These trends perfectly
reflect the dominant effect of venire member
race visible in Figure \ref{fig:racedefmob}. It seems that the defence is much more
likely to reject a white venire member and the prosecution much less
likely.

Slightly attenuating this pattern is the interaction effect between a
white defendant and a white venire member. As noted in Figure
\ref{fig:racedefmob}, there appears to be a tendency for the defence to
prefer venire members of matching race to the defendant while the
prosecution has a tendency to do the opposite. The white defendant
coefficient, which is negative for the prosecution and positive for
the defence, and the interaction effect for white venire members with
white defendants, which is positive for the prosecution and negative
for the defence, matches this observation exactly. Moreover, this seems to be significant based on the plotted confidence
intervals. This suggests that, while the prosecution dominantly rejects black venire
members and the defence dominantly rejects white venire members, the
parties in the courts are sensitive to possible racial matches. The defence
pattern is consistent with a strategy which aims to partially select
venire members to match the defendant race, while the prosecution
partially selects to mismatch.

Such racial patterns in the prosecution and the defence dominate all other effects. The political effect is minor, though
consistent with the hypothesis put forward by (\cite{revesz2016}), with a preference for Republicans by the prosecution and Democrats by the defence.

\subsection{Trial Level Summary} \label{sec:casesum}

The control introduced by linear modelling ignores one critically important dependence that is present between jurors: the case. Cases share lawyers, judges, charges, and other important features which are not adequately controlled by the models fit in Section \ref{sec:mods}.  As it cannot be known why a particular venire member is struck, and modelling the patterns at the venire member level does not account for the close relationship between venire members on the same case, it is possible the aggregate patterns are the result
of some effect other than persistent bias across trials. By
aggregating the venire members by trial and viewing the racial strike
behaviour at this level, insight into the impact of race on challenges at a more relevant scale is gleaned.

\subsubsection{Estimating Struck Juror Counts} \label{subsec:struckjur}

Aggregation required some synthesis, however. One gap present in the Sunshine data was the total count of defence and prosecution strikes for each trial. This
variable is of minor importance for modelling the individual venire
members, but it is of major interest when viewing the trials
themselves. While counts of these strikes were provided in the data, there were many missing values, or values inconsistent with
the number of associated venire members in the data. For example, many of the recorded values in these columns were zero even when
venire members associated with that trial were marked as struck.

To remedy this,  counts of struck venire members with particular characteristics, for example race, were computed for each trial. To
provide an estimate of the total number of venire members struck by each
party, these counts were summed for one particular
variable, typically gender. This sum was then compared to the recorded value for that party's removed count. The greater of the two
values was kept as an estimated count to be used in analysis. For both the prosecution and the defence, about 80\% of the sum and
recorded values matched exactly and about 18\% of the recorded values were less than the sum. This suggests some incompleteness
for the remaining 2\% of the data.

\subsubsection{Visualizing the Racial Trends} \label{subsec:vistrend}

Motivated by the plots in the \texttt{extracat} package in \R
(\cite{extracat}), in particular the \texttt{rmb} plot, the ``positional boxplot'' was developed to display the strike tendencies across
trials. The data visualized by the positional boxplot consists of three parts:
a categorical variable and two integer counts which have many
duplicates in the data. At each unique combination of these counts observed, a box is
placed with two features: an area proportional to the total
number of observations with the corresponding counts, and subdivisions
with horizontal lengths proportional to frequencies of each level of the categorical
variable that occurs with that specific integer combination. In this
case, the categorical variable is the defendant race and the counts
are the peremptory challenges used by the defence and prosecution,
displayed in Figure \ref{fig:trialprodef}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \includegraphics[scale=0.7]{DefProStrikesTrial}
  \caption[Prosecution and Defence Strikes by Trial]{\footnotesize The positional boxplot of strikes by race of defendant for the
    Sunshine data. There does not seem to be a dependence of strike counts on the defendant race, the boxes look similar across
    the entire plot.}
  \label{fig:trialprodef}
\end{figure}

While the internal box patterns look rather similar everywhere, split somewhat evenly between black and white defendants,
their areas are quite revealing. The greater area of boxes below the diagonal line demonstrates clearly the tendency for the defence to use more peremptory challenges than the prosecution in a given case.

However, this plot fails to account for
the total number of black and white venire members presented to the
court in each of the trials. We would expect these numbers to be very
different in the Sunshine data; the different lengths of the
horizontal black lines in Figure \ref{fig:racedefmob} indicate that a
sizeable majority of the venire members are white. To account for
this, the raw strike counts were normalized into proportions of venire
members of the corresponding race. The resulting scatterplots
of these proportions by trial are displayed in Figure \ref{fig:defproprop}.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
  \begin{subfigure}{0.45\textwidth}
    \includegraphics[scale = 0.45]{DefStrProp}
    \caption{\footnotesize Defence proportion venire removed}

  \end{subfigure}
  \caption[Racial Strike Proportions by Party]
  {\footnotesize Scatterplots of venire proportion removed by race for both the defence and prosecution.}
  \label{fig:defproprop}
\end{figure}

Here, the prosecution and defence biases are clear. The prosecution never strikes more than 40\% of white venire members
presented, and on average strikes a greater proportion of the black venire than the white venire. The defence, in contrast,
regularly strikes more than 40\% of the white venire, and on average strikes a greater proportion of the white venire members than
the black venire members. This reinforces the observations made in Section \ref{sec:mods}, indicating that these mechanics
operate at the trial level, not just the venire member level. More crucially, the high variation visible in Figure
\ref{fig:defproprop} suggests that the aggregate patterns described
here and in Section \ref{sec:mods} may be inadequate to describe any individual case.

This plot also reveals a fundamental difference in inclusion of minority and majority groups in juries. The aggregate statistics indicate that the
black venire members are a minority, and Figure \ref{fig:defproprop} suggests that as a consequence, it is common that a majority
or all of the potential black jurors will be struck by peremptory
challenge. There is not a single case where all of the majority white
venire members are struck, suggesting the exclusion of
white venire members is rare, if not impossible. Whether these
peremptories are being used legitimately, the ultimate consequence of
their use is the exclusion of minorities from the juries of cases with
minority defendants. Given the tarnished history of peremptory
challenge for deliberate exclusion, this pattern is concerning.
