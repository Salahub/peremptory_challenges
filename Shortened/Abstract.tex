The legal practice of peremptory challenges is described, outlining its past and present racial controversies as well as the
modern defences typically provided in its favour. These arguments are analyzed statistically using novel visual tools including
the mobile plot and the positional boxplot, which were developed to explore the impact of race on the exercise of peremptory
challenges in three data sets (\cite{JurySunshineProj}, \cite{StubbornLegacy}, and \cite{PerempChalMurder}). Mulitnomial
regression models motivated by these visualizations are fit and used to generate precise parameter estimates which indicate the
dominance of race in peremptory challenge decisions for venire members across all data sets. Trial level summaries of the data
from \cite{JurySunshineProj} are produced and discussed in the context of the results from the venire member models.
