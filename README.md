# Seen to be Done: A Graphical Investigation of Peremptory Challenges

## Christopher Salahub

My master thesis project at ETH Zurich, submitted February
25, 2019. It uses visualizations to explore the contentious legal
practice of peremptory challenges in jury selection. The files are
organized rather simply.

### Analysis

This folder contains the scripts used to process the data to produce
figures and models.

### Data

This folder contains the code used to process the data. As the data
was provided to me by other authors, none of the code files themselves
are placed in this file for public use. If you are interested in the
data, I would direct you to ask the data sources outlined in the paper
for their data. The code here can then be used to process it.

### OldCode

Here you will find old versions of functions I was too sentimental to
delete. None of it was used in final analysis.

### SfSPerempChallenge

The LaTeX folder containing all the raw LaTeX files used to generate
my thesis, alongside figures and other dependencies.

### SeenToBeDone_ChrisSalahub.pdf

My final submitted thesis version, in PDF format.

Please, explore, use, and enjoy. Let me know if anything is amiss.
