## Peremptory Challenge Notes

These notes outline the early investigations into peremptory challenge, listing the papers used and summarizing their major
findings for future reference.

### Batson's Blind Spot: Antony Page

### Idealogical Imbalance and Peremptory Challenge

 - many dislike peremptory challenge
 - dropped in the UK, in Batson vs. Kentucky it was restricted such that a reason besides race or gender must be provided
 - pointed towards the paper "Felony Voire Dire: An Exploratory Study of Its Content and Effect"


### Felony Voire-Dire

 - referenced a lot of other papers on page 3, in particular simulated trial situation data and discussions of the practice of
   voire dire
 - dicussions in the footnote of page 3 of "scientific" voire-dire in which social scientists attempt to predict individual bias
   with greater accuracy than lawyers
 - page 4 mentions a lack of data about voire-dire functioning in the typical courtroom
 - paper examines the jury selection process of four non-capital felony trials in California
   - idea: compare the attitudes of the final selected jury to the initial jury and to a selection of 12 random potential jurors
   - assess the impact of peremptory challenge as a result
   - three study ideas: what happens in voire dire, how useful is it to the lawyers, and how do jurors react
 - in your framework: seems to address the issue of lawyer perceptiveness, but does not actually attempt to see the typical
   difference that is made (small sample size, etc.)
 - paper indicates a difference between felony voire-dire/peremptory challenge and capital/criminal
 - Boehm's index to evaluate tendency to prosecute or acquit used as a measure of juror bias
 - coded transcripts
   - if public data is available, perhaps language processing could be used to create data sets?
 - data is in table 1
